# Getting Started with Lumora

Welcome to Lumora â€” this quick guide shows how to create your first post, add images, and publish.

Follow these steps:

- Write an `index.mdx` file inside a folder under `wwwroot/static/posts/posts/`.
- Export a `meta` object with `title`, `author`, `views`, `likes`, and `slug`.
- Use normal Markdown and MDX for content and components.

Enjoy writing!
